# System Architect: Hybrid Portfolio

Welcome to my digital operations terminal. This repository hosts `index.html`, a highly interactive, sci-fi/industrial digital portfolio designed for GitHub Pages.

## Overview
This single-page portfolio visually represents my career as a **Data Scientist & Operations Leader**. It bridges the gap between my heavy process engineering background (LNG Utilities, Process engineering & Safety) and my expertise in full stack machine learning (Agentic AI, Recommender Systems).

The interface is built to resemble an industrial control panel or futuristic AI data core.

## Technical Aesthetics
*   **Zero Dependencies:** The 3D animations, glowing effects, and terminal interface are built entirely with Vanilla HTML and CSS. No heavy JavaScript frameworks were used.
*   **Isometric 3D Nexus:** The background features a custom CSS-driven 3D animated data core, utilizing deep `perspective` and `transform: translateZ` properties for a true 3D floating effect.
*   **Dynamic CSS Cropping:** The profile picture dynamically crops a full-body structural photograph down to a perfect headshot frame entirely via CSS `object-position` styling.
*   **Live Sensor Simulation:** A lightweight embedded script simulates real-time variations in system load and latency metrics within the sidebar panels.

## Hosting Instructions (GitHub Pages), if you want to create one for yourself
1. Commit and push something like this directory (containing `index.html` and `Picture.jpeg`) to your GitHub repository.
2. In the repository on GitHub, navigate to **Settings**.
3. Go to the **Pages** section on the left sidebar.
4. Under the **Build and deployment** section, select **Deploy from a branch**.
5. Select your `main` or `master` branch and the `/ (root)` folder, then hit **Save**.
6. Wait 1-2 minutes, and your futuristic portfolio will be live at `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repository-name/`.
